# TXRRC_data_harvest

## Data Source
Download files from: https://www.rrc.texas.gov/resource-center/research/data-sets-available-for-download/

* `WorkingFileFor_dbf900.py` references the "Full Wellbore" EBCDIC file named `dbf900.ebc` (which is shared as both a `.gz` and an uncompressed file).

## Changes
* 2021-03-03 - TXRCC have redesigned the website and the locations of the datafiles. We are working to make sure the connections are correct. The file formats look to not be affected at this time.

## About 

TXRRC_data_harvest is a set of tools for downloading and organizing oil and gas well data from the [Texas Railroad Commission](https://www.rrc.texas.gov).

This project is currently in an alpha development stage. It is definitely a work in progress and will take a bit to get fully organized and usable, so please bear with us. 

## Contributing

We are always happy for any help: pull requests, bug reports, feature requests are all appreciated.

## Project goals
The goal is to provide scripts to help download and organize the oil and gas well data provided publicly from the Texas Railroad Commission (TXRRC).


## Getting started

If you are unfamiliar with python, using the notebooks with an .ipynb reader like Jupyter Notebook is a good place to start and test:<br>

## Generation of Python struct from Cobol Copybook Parser

The RRC datasets have PDF files that define the COBOL Copybook statements.
It would be nice to be able to pass these copybook fragments into a python tool
that would then generate the struct format for parsing the raw binary stream.

The work under [Cobol Parser](src/cobol_parser.md) addresses this desire.
